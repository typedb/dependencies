[![Grabl](https://grabl.io/api/status/vaticle/dependencies/badge.svg)](https://grabl.io/vaticle/dependencies)

Bazel dependencies and build tools for [@vaticle](https://github.com/vaticle) repositories.

> This is a publicly accessible repository, and you are free to take inspirations from it. However, **we are not maintaining this codebase for public usage** outside of [@vaticle](https://github.com/vaticle). We will definitely be making changes to it that are specific to [@vaticle](https://github.com/vaticle), and this may break your build system if you depend on this repository from outside of [@vaticle](https://github.com/vaticle).
